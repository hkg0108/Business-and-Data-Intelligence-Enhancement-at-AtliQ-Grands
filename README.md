# Business and Data Intelligence Enhancement at AtliQ Grands
Powerbi Project


-> I made a dashboard for Atliq Company's revenue and booking data.

-> Applied Data Transformation using power query.

-> Defining industry-specific metrics with DAX For example RevPar ,  ADR, Realisation etc...

-> Crafting insightful dashboards using Power BI visualizations.

-> Users can filter by city and room type. There are also filters for revenue by month and week-number. 

-> I added tooltips to explain key measures, like revenue from business and leisure hotels. Plus, there are graphs to show trends in revenue. 

-> Overall, it's an easy way to see how Atliq is doing across different cities and booking channels.
